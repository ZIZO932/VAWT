## Day 1 – January 7  
**Time spent:** ~4.5 hours  

This is day one in the actual construction of the prototype. Since I have already prepared the design and materials, I didn’t have to plan but immediately began with construction. I just took a brief look at the 3D model to ensure that the measurements were accurate, particularly in relation to the placement of blades.

I measured and marked the 3-inch UPVC pipe to cut it into three blades. This stage took me longer than I thought, since I ended up re-measuring to make sure that I have equal blades. I even ended up marking one line incorrectly, which I realized at the end, so I had to erase all markings and start again.

By the end of the day, I managed to cut and clean three straight UPVC blades. Nothing too complicated, but it was nice to finally get started with some actual assembly.

## Day 2 – January 8  
**Time spent:** ~5.5 hours  

For today, I worked on creating a helical structure. I heated up the blades made of UPVC and shaped them inside a cylindrical mold made from a recycling drum of a washing machine. This one required some time because of uneven heating.

The first one did not turn out so well because one side was heating up too much, creating an uneven twist. I reheated it and adjusted its shape, taking it very slowly. I made sure to let each one cool completely before removing it from its mold.

By the end of the day, all three UPVC blades had a definite twist of about 60 degrees. The blades were quite heavy; therefore, I opted to use them as templates instead of the final blades.

## Day 3 – January 9  
**Time spent:** ~7 hours  

After creating them, I realized that the UPVC blades were quite heavy. I grabbed aluminum foil. I used the UPVC blades as a guide to draw out the shapes for my aluminum blades. I adjusted the curves of my design to reflect those of the actual blade.

I had to re-do my outline twice because of a slight misalignment of the curve. Once all looked good, I cut my aluminum foil blades. These came out clean but very thin, so I had to be very careful not to bend them. I utilized a rolling machine to create my helical twist in my aluminum blades. Aluminum foil is much less forgiving than UPVC.

I was comparing aluminum blades to the UPVC templates to ensure a constant twist angle. At the end of the day, I managed to make three functional helical aluminum blades.

## Day 4 – January 10  
**Time spent:** ~5.5 hours  

Today, I spent time on both the Savonius blades and the frame. I cut an aluminum foil sheet in half so that I have two blades that are 32 cm tall and 23.5 cm wide. These were then rolled into semi-cylindrical shapes.

Moving on, I worked on the framework. I cut a 60 cm aluminum rod for my main shaft and six others that are 40 cm long to serve as supports for my blades. I also changed the angle of some recycled plastic angle pieces from 90 to 120 degrees by heating them. One of them cracked, so I had to make a new one.

## Day 5 – January 11  
**Time spent:** ~6 hours 

The assembly and test day has arrived. I inserted the main shaft inside a small iron tube with two bearings. It took longer to align them, as even a tiny misalignment caused friction.

I drilled the blades and attached them to the joints and the main shaft. One of the holes was not spot on, so I adjusted it by hand rather than drilling the blade again.

The gears were already printed, so I only dealt with assembling them into the robot along with wiring the dynamo. I connected the circuit components, including a 3.7V battery, charging module, and breadboard.

First, the testing revealed that the vibes were occurring at a higher speed, so I adjusted the joints to make them tighter and the spacing of the blades accordingly. Once this issue was resolved, the turbine turned over much smoother, and the output of the volts remained steady.
