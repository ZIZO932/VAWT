**Duration:** 5 days  
**Start date:** January 7  

> Research, simulations, and material collection were already completed before this journal.

## Day 1 – January 7  
**Time spent:** ~4.5 hours  

Today was the real start of building. Since I already had the design and materials ready, I didn’t waste time on planning again and went straight into construction. I still checked the 3D model quickly just to make sure the dimensions matched the real materials, especially the blade spacing and shaft length.

I measured and marked the 3-inch UPVC pipe to cut it into three blades. This part took longer than I expected because I kept re-measuring to avoid uneven blades. I actually marked one line wrong and noticed it late, so I erased everything and started over.

By the end of the day, I had three straight UPVC blades cut and cleaned. Nothing complex yet, but it felt good to finally start physically building.

## Day 2 – January 8  
**Time spent:** ~5.5 hours  

Today was focused on forming the helical shape. I heated the UPVC blades and used a recycled washing machine drum as a cylindrical mold. This part needed patience because heating unevenly causes warping.

The first blade didn’t turn out great because I overheated one side, so the twist wasn’t consistent. I reheated it and corrected the shape, and after that I slowed down a lot. I let each blade cool properly before removing it from the mold.

By the end of the day, all three UPVC blades had a consistent helical twist of about **60°**. They were quite heavy, so I decided to use them as **templates** instead of final blades.

## Day 3 – January 9  
**Time spent:** ~7 hours  

Afte making them i found that the UPVC blades where pretty heavy so i bought aluminum foil. I used the UPVC blades as references to prepare the aluminum blade outlines. I adjusted the curves in the design file to match the actual blade shape.

I had to redo the outline twice because the curve alignment was slightly off. Once everything looked right, I laser-cut the aluminum foil blades. They came out clean but very thin, so I had to be careful not to bend them.I used the rolling machine to form the helical twist in the aluminum blades. Aluminum foil is much less forgiving than UPVC.

I kept comparing the aluminum blades to the UPVC templates to keep the twist angle consistent. By the end of the day, I had three usable helical aluminum blades.

## Day 4 – January 10  
**Time spent:** ~5.5 hours  

Today was split between Savonius blades and the structure. I cut an aluminum foil sheet into two equal parts (**32 cm height × 23.5 cm width**) and rolled them into semi-cylindrical shapes.

After that, I worked on the structure. I cut one **60 cm aluminum tube** for the main shaft and **six 40 cm tubes** for blade supports. I also modified recycled plastic angle pieces from **90° to 120°** using heat. One piece cracked during heating, so I had to remake it.

## Day 5 – January 11  
**Time spent:** ~6 hours  

Final assembly and testing day. I installed the main shaft inside a small iron tube with **two bearings**. Alignment took longer than expected—small misalignment caused noticeable friction.

I drilled the blades and connected them to the joints and main shaft. One hole didn’t line up perfectly, so I adjusted it manually instead of re-drilling the blade.

The gears (1:4 ratio, module 1.5) were already printed, so today I focused on fitting them and connecting the dynamo. I wired the circuit using a **3.7V battery**, charging module, and breadboard.

Initial testing showed vibration at higher speed, so I tightened joints and adjusted blade spacing. After fixing that, the turbine rotated more smoothly and the voltage output became more stable.
