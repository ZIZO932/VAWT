Over a period of six days (a total of 28.5 hours), I managed to go from the raw materials stage to having a functioning turbine. Because the design and materials were already determined, this is where the building and the fixing of the issues that arise come into play.

The project also included fixing practical workshop snags such as re-measuring errors, uneven heating during the process of crafting helical blades, reducing blade weight through a switch to aluminum, and aligning bearings and shafts to minimize friction. The journal also indicates how I developed the project design as I constructed it, including the tools and materials employed, and how it significantly improved performance through minute modifications. It concludes with final construction, connecting it electrically via a dynamo and battery system, as well as its success during testing.
